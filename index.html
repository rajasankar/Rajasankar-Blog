<p>In Natural Language Processing, the standard method is to have a tagged corpus to train the algorithm, if the algorithm works, it can be used to generate models which in turn can be used to process new information.</p>

<p>How about trying to extract names, places, unique expressions etc without using a tagged corpus? </p>

<p>Our <strong>NaturalText algorithm</strong> discussed here is doing exactly that. </p>

<p>The algorithm works by processing the full text, trying to find the patterns. Once, patterns were generated, then the patterns were generalized to get the unique words. </p>

<p>Data set used for this is <a href="http://www.statmt.org/europarl/">EU parliament corpus</a></p>

<p>Corpus contains <strong>330k unique words</strong>, after the algorithm processed the text, unique words is <strong>530k</strong>. Size of Corpus is <em>54 million words</em>.</p>

<p>How many unique words extracted by the algorithm? 277K words or <em>52%</em> of unique words. </p>

<p>Download the <a href="">total extracted words</a>. </p>

<p>Algorithm took <strong>8 hours</strong> to extract words in AMD processor with 16 GB memory running python on Ubuntu. </p>

<p>What about the accuracy of the extracted words? </p>

<p>As this algorithm used raw text, I haven't ran those metrics. Next step would be that. Using pre-tagged data would be a easier to do this. <a href="http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2013/05/01/umbc-webbase-corpus-of-3b-english-words/">UMBC WebBase corpus</a> or <a href="https://www.anc.org/data/oanc/download/">OANC_GrAF corpus</a> could be used for this. I am also planning to use some scientific texts too. </p>

<p>What is the unique about this algorithm compared to all the Natural Language Processing algorithms out there?</p>

<p>This algorithm can be applied to any text to extract the information. This can be applied <em>any language without requiring tagged Corpus</em>. This can be applied to text of any domain/field. </p>

<p>I think algorithm may be used to find relationship between words or extracting facts from the text. Even the synonym/antonym or sentiments. </p>

<p>I will keep posting the results. </p>
