Once, patterns were generated, then the patterns were generalized to get the unique words. \r\n\r\nData set used for this is [EU parliament corpus](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/)\r\n\r\nCorpus contains **330k unique words**, after the algorithm processed the text, unique words is **530k**. Size of Corpus is *54 million words*.\r\n\r\nHow many unique words extracted by the algorithm? 277K words or *52%* of unique words. \r\n\r\nDownload the [total extracted words](). \r\n\r\nAlgorithm took **8 hours** to extract words in AMD processor with 16 GB memory running python on Ubuntu. \r\n\r\nWhat about the accuracy of the extracted words? \r\n\r\nAs this algorithm used raw text, I haven't ran those metrics. Next step would be that. Using pre-tagged data would be a easier to do this. [UMBC WebBase corpus] (http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2013/05/01/umbc-webbase-corpus-of-3b-english-words/) or [OANC_GrAF corpus] (https://www.anc.org/data/oanc/download/ ) could be used for this. I am also planning to use some scientific texts too. \r\n\r\nWhat is the unique about this algorithm compared to all the Natural Language Processing algorithms out there?\r\n\r\nThis algorithm can be applied to any text to extract the information. This can be applied *any language without requiring tagged Corpus*. This can be applied to text of any domain/field. \r\n\r\nI think algorithm may be used to find relationship between words or extracting facts from the text. Even the synonym/antonym or sentiments. \r\n\r\nI will keep posting the results. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
